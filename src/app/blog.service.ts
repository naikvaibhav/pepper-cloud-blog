      "bodyHtml": "On the way to buy glorious flowers at the Ghazipur wholesale market in east Delhi, it is impossible to miss the mountain of garbage on the right flank of the highway, euphemistically called a landfill. Kites circle endlessly over the noxious escarpment and hidden fires emit spires of smoke as dumper trunks snake up to unload more rotting waste.\n\nThere is no starker evidence of how much garbage modern cities – that is, all of us residents – create every day. Thankfully Indians still have not reached the wastage levels of the so-called “developed” countries of the west. Even so, our sheer numbers make up for the low per capita waste generation. And the landfills keep rising.\n\nEvery year New York generates over four million tons of waste, of which a third is discarded food. That rots and emits the greenhouse gas methane. But at least the city authorities there have been working with generators of food waste – individuals and restaurants -to curb output so that that the landfills will eventually stop growing.\n\nAn eastern nation like Singapore has taken a different tack. It’s solid waste generation rose marginally in 2016 to 7.81 million tonnes but so did its recycling – especially construction debris. More importantly, domestic waste generation dropped a bit from 2.13 million tonnes in 2015 to 2.09 million tonnes in 2016 and recycling increased.\n\nThat’s because the Singapore government has been combatting food wastage at many levels, including consumption. Freedom to Squander – the latest battle cry against Consumer Affairs and Food minister Ram Vilas Paswan’s inarticulate advocacy of listing portion sizes on menus to curb over inadvertent ordering-would clearly cut no ice there!\n\nSingapore’s National Environment Agency’s food waste management strategy says “The preferred way to manage food waste is to avoid wasting food at the onset”. So since 2015, it has been conducting programmes for “smart food purchase” and teaching ways to cook and store food that minimise wastage at source and save money.\n\nIt has also put out relevant content in the media including online and reached out to schools and food retail brands to join this effort to “remind and encourage” people not to waste food. It has even produced a waste minimisation guidebook for restaurants and supply chains in collaboration with major international hotel groups.\n\nParticularly those Indians prematurely protesting about supposed curbs on what or how much we can eat, may be interested to learn that the guidebook has a separate section called “food portion management”. It suggests restaurants offer “different portion choices or indicate serving sizes in menus (e.g. for sharing by 3 – 4 persons)”.\n\nIt also advocates restaurant wait staff be “well-informed on serving sizes and ingredients of dishes in the menu” in order to “minimise food wastage by customers”.\n\nMaking staff aware of food waste reduction initiatives is also suggested. Sounds like our minister was inspired by this Singapore initiative to broach an Indian variant, if incoherently.\n\nWhile eating more judiciously – as the PM suggested in a recent Mann ki Baat – is a sensible personal initiative to opt for, an incident last October showed me the value of listing portion sizes and training staff to help people order correctly.In our case, it would have prevented under-ordering and not left us with a bad taste in the mouth.\n\nAt a (then) newly opened restaurant in a five star hotel, we were burdened with a surprisingly taciturn and singularly unhelpful staff. So we went by the prices to guess portion sizes. At Rs 500++ I reasoned that one portion of steamed rice would suffice for the three of us as we tend to focus on the proteins rather than carbs when eating out.\n\nThe rice turned out to be barely three tablespoons’ worth. The duck portion was equally measly. Had portion sizes been mentioned or staff trained, we would have been saved a lot of time and trouble. We can try to eat less, waste less and thus not make Ghazipur’s garbage mountain rise as fast. Why can’t restaurants help us do so too?\n\nRestaurants create half a million tons of food waste a year in New York. It’s estimated that if just 5% of them reduce wastage by donating uneaten food or composting leftovers, landfills could shrink 14%. Residents have been pitching in by composting organic waste in individual or community plots, but how about simply wasting less?",

      "bodyHtml": "The dish set before me was deceptively simple: black cod with carrots. Chef Mario Paecke of the Michelin-starred Luce D’Oro at Schloss Elmau in Bavaria doesn’t waste words either as it is listed as just that. No fancy, cheffy terms like jus, confit or sous vide leap out to befuddle me.\n\nBut the dish is brilliant in its simplicity: the cod is tender and flavourful and the carrots done three ways are a revelation.\n\nIn essence it is not unGerman – Paecke calls it his ode to winter – as my mother’s stories of living in Berlin circa 1955 also revolve around basic proteins and root vegetables in winter. Only, there was no Paecke back then to turn them simple into special, so my vegetarian mother had to make do with roasted or boiled tubers (Indian spices were not available) or brave the fermented charms of pickled cabbage.\n\nBut Paecke’s first-ever menu at The Oberoi Gurgaon this week once again demonstrates shows how tremendously cuisine has evolved in the past six decades, especially in the west. Simultaneous advances in technology and rising popular interest in food has led to what can only be called a gastronomic revolution, not a renaissance. There was nothing quite like this culinary efflorescence in times past.\n\nThe Guide Michelin has played no small part in this with its starry inducements, leading sometimes to fussy food. For a long while chefs competed to complicate good ingredients, dishing out foams, reductions, mousses and crumbles to shock and awe diners–and justify their prices.\n\nNot that anyone should complain, as it takes a great deal of talent and phenomenal technical skill to do what they do.\n\nWhat has happened lately, however, to ‘intercontinental” cuisine–stretching from America to Australia via Europe–is a move towards clever simplicity. It is now about using technology help the natural flavours of ingredients do the wowing, like Paecke’s butternut squash “pearl” with its lime gelee casing, silky cauliflower puree, sous vide and seared cod, or indeed his apple, ginger and toffee riffs.\n\nThe rising interest in food has not uniformly led to better or more home cooking around the world. But it could be argued that as amateur cooks get more adventurous and skilled in their own kitchens, their expectations from the professionals can only increase too. They will also become more discerning and less impressed by mere technical wizardry if there is no corresponding enhancement of flavor.\n\nScience is slowly revealing that we are more like the rest of the animal kingdom than we originally believed. Many of them also love, grieve, laugh, cry, remember, learn, avenge and even paint, dance and sing as we do, albeit in differing ways. So cooking seems to be the only skill that truly sets us humans apart from them and as such needs to be appreciated as much as any other science or art.\n\nCuisine is a major component of the soft power game and India needs to get its act together. The challenge is to find space for our multifarious cuisines without succumbing to the mug’s game of playing by someone else’s rules. If we foam and puree, sous vide and dehydrate unnecessarily, our cuisine will become a parody.\n\nPlenty of Indian techniques can be developed and showcased to equal effect.Indian food is not only about chillies and spices, orange gravies, kebabs and curries. We have a wide repertoire of indigenous ingredients that can amaze the world, just as truffles or caviar have done for decades.\n\nMore top practitioners of our culinary arts need to evolve their own expositions, rediscovering for their diners, ancient but little-known techniques and ingredients, occasionally reinventing them if need be.\n\nManish Mehrotra and Gaggan Anand, temperamentally utterly dissimilar, represent moves towards that end, as much as Sriram Aylur, Vineet Bhatia, Atul Kochhar and others. But our culinary outreach still needs an intelligent fillip, along the lines of the ongoing annual Gout d’France that celebrates French food with events on the same day around the world, pressing home its natural advantage in haute cuisine.\n\nYet, the huge market of amateur home cooks, primed by Masterchef, awaits a taste of the true diversity of Indian cuisine too. And our chefs don’t need a Michelin “chhaap”–which is predicated on western norms anyway—to get out there and wow diners worldwide. Someone in Germany needs to be as impressed by an Indian chef’s brilliant simplicity just as I was in Gurgaon by a German chef’s.",

      "bodyHtml": "What’s going on? How come this Japanese restaurant has come to Juhu via Bahrain? Ruka is the first Indian outpost of a Japanese restaurant chain from Bahrain and coincidentally Japanese food-loving gourmet couple, the Mehrotras, have just returned from a highly successful showing in ‘Art Bahrain’. Jaideep Mehrotra, one of our inventive contemporary artistes creates powerful artworks, which are internationally prized, too. I am happy to report that Jaideep uses his creativity to make fabulous cocktails, cook inventive dishes and experiment with unique flavours. His lovely wife, Seema handles the Mehrotra home, taxes, investments as well as the creative mood swings of her family.\n\nWe nibble our way into the night and the Mehrotra’s love of wines, chocolates, coffee and Japanese food shines through. Our\nreview follows.\n\nDécor\n\nRelaxed, dimly lit, this 5,000, sq ft restaurant is located on the ground floor of Juhu’s Ramee Guestline Hotel. An open kitchen, a sushi bar and walls laden with tanks containing seafood complete the decor.\n\nFood\n\nA large, rambling menu, which has plenty for vegetarians and molecular cocktails are the highlights here. Start off with the nibbling of Steamed Edamame (which could’ve done with more of the sea salt). The Spicy Tuna Roll is spiked with the perfect amount of spice, freshest of avocado and salmon in the Sushi Roll. While the Sashimi and Sushi are fresh and well-made, they are not exceptional. Crisp, airy and light Tempura, (superb Enoki), moist, flavoursome Pot Rice, plenty of vegetarian options and Chocolate and Hazelnut Fondant (with the perfect balance of sweetness) are some of\nthe highlights.\n\nFinally, Ruka teases an ideal exquisite tenderness and kiss of sweetness from the Miso Black Cod, which made this dish the star of the night for us.\n\nMinus point\n\nThe draft from the air conditioner to the fact that there was no Unagi were the downsides. As also mushy filling of the thick skinned veg Cheong Fun, the oversized plump Sushi and the lacklustre Truffle Edamame.\n\nMy point\nAn open-all-day, Japanese restaurant and lounge with a casual vibe, and molecular cocktails are Ruka’s plus points. While the Japanese food offerings are plentiful, experienced in aggregate, too many dishes are too blunt. The overall flavour spectrum could do with fine-tuning. A pleasant enough experience, but not one we would go back for, in a hurry!\n\nRuka\nGround Floor, 462,\nAB Nair Road, Juhu\nCall: 022-6715 9225\nMeal for two:  Rs 5,000\nOpen 12 pm to 3 am\n\nRating and Food: 3\nService: 3.5\nDécor: 3\n\n",

       "bodyHtml": "What do I do when I hear of this new, casual, relaxed, fun restaurant that has set up in Versova? Meet up with relaxed, fun girlfriends for a casual drink and a bite of course.\n\nThe brilliant and hugely in demand hairstylist Natasha Sara is also a canine trainer behaviourist. Anshu Aurora, costume designer cooks, bakes and paints, while stylist Vishakha Shinde is now devoting plenty of time to travel. Our conversation about these diverse and interesting subjects make my evening sparkle so much, that the average and below average food ceases to matter.\n\nDécor\n\nPerched on the busy main road, this house has trees growing through it — graffitti on the walls and is that a motor cycle parked in here? We walk in through the open porch, with tables on the sides, a buzzing ground level bar and lounge and upto the first floor, decorated like a living room with wooden seating and colourful cushions. There’s an open-air smoking zone too.\n\nFood\n\nThe multi-cuisine menu zigs zags all over and tries to please everywhere. Check for the main course specials of the day written on the blackboard. Well-made soft paneer, potato jalapeno and Thai cigar just about pass muster, as does the cheesecake. The friendly and helpful manager Cajetan was a plus point for sure.\n\nMinus points \n\nSome of the dishes were too greasy, others undersalted, some over sauced, the prawns were not fresh in one dish.\n\nStodgy garlic cheese bread, lacklustre Thai curry. Noisy, loud, very loud music. There is a competition just round the corner. Jamjar Diner with a somewhat similar but more intricately done up ambience offers somewhat better food.\n\nMy point\n\nThe house takes its name very seriously. And so you do feel you are in someone’s very casually done up intersting bungalow. Also one where the food is definitely not worth going back for, but if you have fun company (like I did) then it sure is worth it.\n\nRating\n\nFood: 2.5\nService: 3.5\nDécor: 3.5\n\n",

      "bodyHtml": "One of the most special parts of a meal is listening to the chef, the one who toiled and tailored the spread, talk about the stories and inspirations behind each and every dish. But it’s an experience that is sadly missing in many restaurants because they cook and cater on a very different scale. We don’t blame them. But we do crave something more…. personal, yet peppered with passion.\n\nThis is something that lures diners to our platform and what encourages more home cooks to share their culinary heritage.\n\nOur home chefs are still in the hospitality business, in a way. But they do it on their own terms and in their own special ways. Here are some of Bangalore’s most wonderful Un-Restaurateurs who are changing the way we experience our meals.\n\n\nTapti: “I share my culture and heritage with my diners through my food.”\n\nTapti Patniak has always loved to cook and experiment with food. It was only fitting that she would sign up to Authenticook when it launched in Bengaluru. While she is adept in many different cuisines, she decided to go back to her roots – to Orissa – when she planned out her menu. The result: An authentic Odia meal with simple, everyday flavours and a slice of her culture and heritage.\n\n“Everything I know about Odia food, I learned from my mother and grandmother,” she says. “My childhood was spent in Orissa gathered around friends, family and food. Every one of my dishes has a story. Through my cooking, I share my culture and heritage with my diners.”\n\nSumitra: “You will not find this style of food in any restaurant in Bangalore.”\n\nWhat started off as a passion for food turned into a business for home chef, Sumitra (last name) when diners started to realise how niche and unique her food was. Indeed, she makes a good point when she passionately proclaims that her style of food, Andhra Brahmin from the West Godavari district, is impossible to find anywhere outside of Andhra Pradesh.\n\nWell, Bangalore is rather lucky to have someone as passionate as Sumitra sharing her unique flavours with us. Yes, it’s vegetarian and almost sattvic in his shunning of onions and garlic. But those who have dined at her abode keep returning for more.\n\n“My food is very simple,” she says. “But it’s also very unique. Unless you try it, you will never understand the beauty of the flavours.",

We all love monsoon for different reasons – cool air, breezy days, gloomy skies, green surroundings, and the muddy aroma. With such a pleasant climate, the showers end up with enormous food cravings for some hot delicacies along with a hot cup of tea. Being such a diverse country, every Indian state has its own monsoon delicacies to satisfy your cravings with lip-smacking flavours and fragrances. We have a number of options like hot pakoras, cutlets, vadas, and the list goes on. Let’s lighten up this monsoon with these special nibbles from different parts of the country that are perfectly suited for the weather.\n\nPakoras with Chai\nThere is something tempting about fried food, especially when it's raining outside and you just can't resist picking up pakoras. On that typical rainy day, all you want is a hot plate of pakoras along with the piping hot ginger tea. Pakoras are all-time favourite snack made with mix vegetables and chickpea flour.\n\nBun Makkhan Samosas\nHow about steaming hot samosas along with bun makkhan on a rainy evening? Stuffed with mashed potatoes, peas and a whole melange of aromatic flavours, Samosa is country’s one of the most popular snacks. One can find this unique combination of samosa and bun makkhan along with a kulhad chai in the city of Nawabs, Lucknow. Freshly fried samosas and its aroma will surely give hunger pangs to anyone.\n\nGoli Baje\nA typical Mangalorean bonda, Goli Baje is prepared with all purpose flour, sour curd and topped with ginger and grated coconut.

      "bodyHtml":"We discover something unique with every home chef we converse with or every regional cuisine of India that we come across. Flatbreads or breads are something that are a part of each and every meal in all parts of India. While we have already touched upon the ones that hail from the northern parts of India (check out the blog, here), check out the flatbreads that the Western part of India thoroughly enjoys.\n\nPURAN POLI\nThe heart of Maharashtra’s sweetness, Puran Poli is a flatbread made with split yellow gram (chana dal), plain flour, jaggery, cardamom/nutmeg powder, ghee and water. It is a wafer-thin flatbread that simply melts in your mouth, leaving behind a subtle sweetness. It is known as Holige in Kannada, Vedmi in Gujarati and Bobbatlu in Telugu. \n\nBE-PADI ROTLI\n\n\n\nIt is a typical Gujarati flatbread that is a part of a daily meal in any Gujarati home during summers. The ingredients and dough are the same for the quintessential Phulkas and Gujarati Be-Padi Rotlis, it’s the technique of rolling them and preparing them that makes the two so different. When you have friends and family over, this turns out to be a great way to keep up with the pace of providing hot rotis at the table without anyone having to wait since two can be made at the same time!\n\nBHAKRI\nYou will find bhakri being prepared in parts of Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Goa and Central India. A bhakri can be hard or soft in texture, depending on personal preference. It is a farmer’s food who used to carry it at the crack of dawn to the fields and enjoy it for lunch. Since it is made with jowar, ragi and other nutritious grains, it keeps hunger at bay and boosts your body with energy for a long time. It goes well with chutney, thecha, baingan ka bharta (made with roasted eggplants) or with pithla or zunka (made in the Deccan region). In North Karnataka, it goes by the name Jolada Rotti and is the staple diet of the region. To make the bhakri, the dough needs to be stiff and can be flattened between your palms. \n\nFUGIAS\nThis pillowy and round, golden-brown East Indian bread is simply divine. They are prepared with a slightly fermented and sweet batter and served at weddings and special occasions. It is an art to get the fugias perfectly round and beat it just enough to make the batter airy. They pair very well with curries (flavoured with the East Indian bottle masala of course) and should be had hot. You can know more about the East Indian community and check out home chef Regina’s recipe for making Fugias at home, here.\n\n",

Every region and every regional community has its own set of dishes or drinks that change with time. Accommodating seasonal fruits and vegetables into their daily diet in different ways requires a certain creativity that Indians are well-known for.\n\nThe beginning, accompaniment and end of almost every meal in India is a beverage. It can be something as simple as buttermilk or coconut water or filter coffee that can be had throughout the year or something like Aam Panna that is specific to summer in India. We have curated a list of unique regional drinks found in India that you must try while visiting the state or city depending on the season.  \n\nNOON CHAI \nEver had a cup of tea that’s pink in colour and slightly salty? Noon Chai is a popular beverage consumed in Kashmir and enjoyed with a choice of flatbreads such as Sheermal, Lavasa, Bakarkhani (know more about these flatbreads here). It also goes by the name ‘Sheer Chai’ in Afghanistan but requires an acquired taste and is not everyone’s cup of tea (literally). The drink is made with milk, salt and baking soda (lends the drink its pink colour) in a samovar, a Russian container used for heating water. When winter sets in Jammu & Kashmir and parts of Himachal Pradesh, the locals drink Noon Chai 2-3 times a day to keep themselves warm.\n\nJAMBUL\nOften found in most Koli homes, Jambul is a home-brewed, purple-hued drink made from the black plums (jamun) or zamla, as its called in the Konkan region. Today, the concoction is available in markets but there is a certain authenticity that comes from having it with a homemade Koli meal served at the home of a local fisherfolk family. The fruit is not indigenous to India but was introduced by the Portuguese. The drink is a storehouse of vitamin C and helps the body tackle various ailments and diseases. You can even let the pulp ferment to make it slightly alcoholic (like your own version of homemade wine).\n\nHANDIA\nHandia in Bihar, Chattisgarh and West Bengal (or Chuak in Tripura) is a rice beer that is generally served on special occasions and festivals. It is made with ranu tablets comprising of 26 herbs added to boiled rice and left to ferment for a week. This is what you will consider as desi daaru (country liquor) and is enjoyed during summers! The name comes from the term ‘Handi’ which is a large-mouthed mud vessel with a narrow neck that plays a crucial role in Indian regional cooking. It is offered to deities as well as the elders of the family.\n\nJIGARTHANDA \nIt is a common drink found on the streets of Madurai, Tamil Nadu. The city is known for its temples and eclectic food choices such as rabbit biryani and butterfish curry. But the best way to wash it down is with a cooling glass of Jil Jil Jigarthanda. It is basically chilled milk mixed with sugar, almond gum, China grass, sarsaparilla syrup, resin and basundi. It’s effect? Exactly what the name suggests - cools you down from head to toe to tackle the heat.",
